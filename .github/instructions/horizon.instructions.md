# Developing flow
0. Create a TASKS.md file with a list of tasks to be done.
1. Create a Docker environment for your application.
2. Use this git repository to track your changes [https://github.com/marcellopato/horizon.git]
3. Always create a new branch for each feature you work on.
4. Make sure to commit your changes frequently with meaningful messages.
5. Let's use Laravel+TailwindCSS with MySQL.
6. Make sure to write a README file with setup instructions and any other relevant information.
7. Once the TASKS.md file is complete, start working on the tasks in order. When it is complete, let's create a branch just for PHPUnit tests and write tests for the application.
8. Once everything is done, create a Loom video showing the application in action and explaining the code.
9. Finally, send the link to the git repository, the Loom video, and any other relevant information to the email address provided.
